Machine Learning Algorithms For Breast Cancer Data


The problem is to ensure that the breast cancer cell is 
determined as benign or malignant by using the information 
given to us in the breast cancer data set. I aim to diagnose breast 
cancer faster and more quickly. Also, I searched for answers to 
these questions; which machine learning model most accurate of 
classification score and what pathological feature is most 
important for diagnosing breast cancer.

The prediction of breast cancer recurrence. In this paper, 
I analyzed cancer data using two classification techniques to 
predict the recurrence of the cancer and then compared the 
results. The results indicated that KNN is the way better
classifier predictor with the test dataset. Further studies should 
be conducted to improve performance of these classification 
techniques by using more variables and choosing for a longer
follow-up duration.
